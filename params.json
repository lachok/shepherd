{"name":"Shepherd","tagline":"Capture useful data about your users' actions on your website up to the moment they send feedback","body":"Shepherd provides insight into a user's last actions before submitting feedback on your site. This is so that:\r\n* It's easy for users to submit feedback\r\n* It's easy for developers to understand feedback\r\n\r\nIt does this by providing a simple and extensible interface for defining user actions that need to be tracked, and storing them in the browser's local storage. When the user wants to submit feedback the saved actions can be submitted as well.\r\n\r\n### Philosophy\r\n* Shepherd is easy to use and configure\r\n* It's a single javascript file that can be dropped into a website and provide the promised functionality\r\n* It integrates with popular feedback forms/plugins (which ones?)\r\n* It has a minimum set of dependencies\r\n* It's modular and its functionality can be configured and extended by choosing which modules are included\r\n\r\n### Project status\r\nAt the moment this is more a proof-of-concept than anything really useful. The main file (shepherd.js) contains [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) headers so that it can be injected into any website for testing.\r\n","google":"UA-64338314-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
